## Leonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of Man
### Martin Clayton
An album of paintings/drawings about the mechanics of man by DaVinci. He dissected the corpse himself to understand the muscleskeleton system: why human could walk, reach and grasp. To fully show the muscleskeleton, he drawed each part from multiple views with lots of notes. It's hard for me to imagine how he dealt with the smell of corpse, the body fluid and so on. Also, his skills of drawing is amazing. In the spine drawing, the shadow processing is so subtle. Since then, I started to pay attention to the muscle, ligaments, tendon, and how they combine with skeleton to drive movement when I eat the leg, feet of the chicken.
