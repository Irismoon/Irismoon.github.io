## Leonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of Man
### Martin Clayton
An album of paintings/drawings about the mechanics of man by DaVinci. He dissected the corpse himself to understand the muscleskeleton system: why human could walk, reach and grasp. To fully show the muscleskeleton, he drawed each part from multiple views with lots of notes. It's hard for me to imagine how he dealt with the smell of corpse, the body fluid and so on. Also, his skills of drawing is amazing. In the spine drawing, the shadow processing is so subtle. Since then, I started to pay attention to the muscle, ligaments, tendon, and how they combine with skeleton to drive movement when I eat the leg, feet of the chicken. 
## Phishing for Phools
### George A. Akerlof
This book mainly talked about the deception in the free economic system, including the substandard product, the flattering from the salesman to persuade you to buy the products you don't really need, the comercial advertisement which distract your attention, and manipulating the political election, financial system, etc.. It shows how maximizing personal profit conflicts with the benefit of the whole world. 
The spirit of the free economic system is the supply and need, which leads to the best deployment of the resources. However, we must be aware that we have so much fake need which is created/allured by the commercial system rather than based on our own needs. That's why the author says about we are manipulated and deceived by others. The hope is that at least in China, the government set regulation that the advertisement is not allowed to exaggerate the effect of the product. And more and more NGOs, other organizations is enhancing supervision. 
Of course, the deception and manipulation exists not only in the economic acticities but also in others like cheat in exam, lie to family, etc.. And this is not the problem of free economic system. It will also appear in the planned economy, but may in another look.  
In summary, it's a good book and I finish it. I enhance my resistance level of commercial advertisement and unhealthy food. But beyond myself, this deception and manipulation is still a severe waste of social resources. What could we do to make the deployment of the resources better?
## Pride and Prejudice
### Jane Austin
I watched the movie and not the book. I would ask: what if there is no a man like Darcy? How will Lizzie spend the rest of her life? Where will she get enough money? Ans she will have new trouble in dealing with her family. Because her family are anticipating that her marriage to a rich man brings fortune to the whole family. The novel returns a happy ending. But in reality, everyone just goes his own way of answer. People's willing is precious and worth respecting. 
Back to the story itself, something interesting for me is the change of a normal woman, i.e. the mother in the novel. She is very real, even in nowadays, around me, in my home. They impose their willings on their children even if they don't really know their children. They were also pretty young ladies and gradually become snobbish, greedy, peremptory. Surely maybe I'm prejudiced because I don't really understand their situation. But they are also changing. In some cases, they really express their true love for their children like when Lidvy went away, the mom really cry out of real love. But most of time, they shadow the love by others I disagree. This detail is where I truly highly evaluate the movie. It's so real description of humanity. 
Out of the novel and come for me, did I respect my own willing? Did I inresponsibly replace my own willing with others'? I didn't respect my own such that other things just intrude my mind in various disguise. They are fiercely rapping me setting my willing aside. When many principles are in front, which one will I use it make decision?
