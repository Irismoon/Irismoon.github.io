## Leonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of Man
### Martin Clayton
An album of paintings/drawings about the mechanics of man by DaVinci. He dissected the corpse himself to understand the muscleskeleton system: why human could walk, reach and grasp. To fully show the muscleskeleton, he drawed each part from multiple views with lots of notes. It's hard for me to imagine how he dealt with the smell of corpse, the body fluid and so on. Also, his skills of drawing is amazing. In the spine drawing, the shadow processing is so subtle. Since then, I started to pay attention to the muscle, ligaments, tendon, and how they combine with skeleton to drive movement when I eat the leg, feet of the chicken. 
## Phishing for Phools
### George A. Akerlof
This book mainly talked about the deception in the free economic system, including the substandard product, the flattering from the salesman to persuade you to buy the products you don't really need, the comercial advertisement which distract your attention, and manipulating the political election, financial system, etc.. It shows how maximizing personal profit conflicts with the benefit of the whole world. 
The spirit of the free economic system is the supply and need, which leads to the best deployment of the resources. However, we must be aware that we have so much fake need which is created/allured by the commercial system rather than based on our own needs. That's why the author says about we are manipulated and deceived by others. The hope is that at least in China, the government set regulation that the advertisement is not allowed to exaggerate the effect of the product. And more and more NGOs, other organizations is enhancing supervision. 
Of course, the deception and manipulation exists not only in the economic acticities but also in others like cheat in exam, lie to family, etc.. And this is not the problem of free economic system. It will also appear in the planned economy, but may in another look.  
In summary, it's a good book and I finish it. I enhance my resistance level of commercial advertisement and unhealthy food. But beyond myself, this deception and manipulation is still a severe waste of social resources. What could we do to make the deployment of the resources better?
## Pride and Prejudice
### Jane Austin
I watched the movie and not the book. I would ask: what if there is no a man like Darcy? How will Lizzie spend the rest of her life? Where will she get enough money? Ans she will have new trouble in dealing with her family. Because her family are anticipating that her marriage to a rich man brings fortune to the whole family. The novel returns a happy ending. But in reality, everyone just goes his own way of answer. People's willing is precious and worth respecting. 
Back to the story itself, something interesting for me is the change of a normal woman, i.e. the mother in the novel. She is very real, even in nowadays, around me, in my home. They impose their willings on their children even if they don't really know their children. They were also pretty young ladies and gradually become snobbish, greedy, peremptory. Surely maybe I'm prejudiced because I don't really understand their situation. But they are also changing. In some cases, they really express their true love for their children like when Lidvy went away, the mom really cry out of real love. But most of time, they shadow the love by others I disagree. This detail is where I truly highly evaluate the movie. It's so real description of humanity. 
Out of the novel and come for me, did I respect my own willing? Did I inresponsibly replace my own willing with others'? I didn't respect my own such that other things just intrude my mind in various disguise. They are fiercely rapping me setting my willing aside. When many principles are in front, which one will I use it make decision?
%%%%%%Update%%%%%%%%
I read the book these days. What most interests me is that the people described in the book is very similar to the people in China, like Mrs. Bennet similar to my mother, and people care and gossip about eloping, and girls show learn drawing, etc., and marriage with cousins. These things are very similar.
But the noble in English is different from that in ancient China is that they truly cultivate good quality of people like thinking others kind while those in China like the Jia family described in famous novel Hongloumeng are actually very indecent/stupid in spirit except richness. And the noble in English is small-family(similar to modern family) style while that in China is big-family style(many generation people live together). Also people in English is less constrained than ancient China, like Mr and Mrs is pretty equal in family affairs while one man has several wives and the wife are severely constrained by Confucianism in ancient China.   

Compare Elizabeth and Jane to the girls in Hongloumeng(HLM) in nearly the same era is also very interesting. First, HLM girls are not allowed to go outdoos and meet other single man except their brother Jiabaoyu. The life they live is the same everyday, wherea English girls surely not so(they could travel and appear in public). Second, the most important thing for both of them is the marriage. English has balls for the young ladies and men meet each other (at least free to choose among many young men) while  HLM know nothing about men but their father, could only be arranged for marriage. And HLM girls are married very young about 15 years old while 20+ years old in English. Xuebaochai and Lindaiyu in HLM are as smart as Elizabeth, in judging others' character, in literature, in analyzing the affairs. But their environment is much severer than Lizze's that they almost never correctly rebel against the fate arranged (if the death of Lindaiyu could be seen as a negative rebellion). Everybody is saying good to maintain a superficial peace in family especially towards the grandmother. 

In summary, this is a good book, in terms of its content, well describing how a young couple learned to know each other which they valued most for their marriage and how the character of a person could be changed gradually by their reflection, their own free judgement, even in a not good family environment(her mother). And the mental activity of people is detailed and vivid. The writing style is active and easy to read, although I don't like the complex sentence structure which is pretty difficult for a non-native English learner. I want to read another book with broader view dealing with the inferior class like the maid, housekeeper.
