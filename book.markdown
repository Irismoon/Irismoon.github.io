## Leonardo da Vinci: The Mechanics of Man
### Martin Clayton
An album of paintings/drawings about the mechanics of man by DaVinci. He dissected the corpse himself to understand the muscleskeleton system: why human could walk, reach and grasp. To fully show the muscleskeleton, he drawed each part from multiple views with lots of notes. It's hard for me to imagine how he dealt with the smell of corpse, the body fluid and so on. Also, his skills of drawing is amazing. In the spine drawing, the shadow processing is so subtle. Since then, I started to pay attention to the muscle, ligaments, tendon, and how they combine with skeleton to drive movement when I eat the leg, feet of the chicken. 
## Phishing for Phools
### George A. Akerlof
This book mainly talked about the deception in the free economic system, including the substandard product, the flattering from the salesman to persuade you to buy the products you don't really need, the comercial advertisement which distract your attention, and manipulating the political election, financial system, etc.. It shows how maximizing personal profit conflicts with the benefit of the whole world. 
The spirit of the free economic system is the supply and need, which leads to the best deployment of the resources. However, we must be aware that we have so much fake need which is created/allured by the commercial system rather than based on our own needs. That's why the author says about we are manipulated and deceived by others. The hope is that at least in China, the government set regulation that the advertisement is not allowed to exaggerate the effect of the product. And more and more NGOs, other organizations is enhancing supervision. 
Of course, the deception and manipulation exists not only in the economic acticities but also in others like cheat in exam, lie to family, etc.. And this is not the problem of free economic system. It will also appear in the planned economy, but may in another look.  
In summary, it's a good book and I finish it. I enhance my resistance level of commercial advertisement and unhealthy food. But beyond myself, this deception and manipulation is still a severe waste of social resources. What could we do to make the deployment of the resources better?
## Pride and Prejudice
### Jane Austin
I watched the movie and not the book. I would ask: what if there is no a man like Darcy? How will Lizzie spend the rest of her life? Where will she get enough money? Ans she will have new trouble in dealing with her family. Because her family are anticipating that her marriage to a rich man brings fortune to the whole family. The novel returns a happy ending. But in reality, everyone just goes his own way of answer. People's willing is precious and worth respecting. 
Back to the story itself, something interesting for me is the change of a normal woman, i.e. the mother in the novel. She is very real, even in nowadays, around me, in my home. They impose their willings on their children even if they don't really know their children. They were also pretty young ladies and gradually become snobbish, greedy, peremptory. Surely maybe I'm prejudiced because I don't really understand their situation. But they are also changing. In some cases, they really express their true love for their children like when Lidvy went away, the mom really cry out of real love. But most of time, they shadow the love by others I disagree. This detail is where I truly highly evaluate the movie. It's so real description of humanity. 
Out of the novel and come for me, did I respect my own willing? Did I inresponsibly replace my own willing with others'? I didn't respect my own such that other things just intrude my mind in various disguise. They are fiercely rapping me setting my willing aside. When many principles are in front, which one will I use it make decision?
%%%%%%Update%%%%%%%%
I read the book these days. What most interests me is that the people described in the book is very similar to the people in China, like Mrs. Bennet similar to my mother, and people care and gossip about eloping, and girls show learn drawing, etc., and marriage with cousins. These things are very similar.
But the noble in English is different from that in ancient China is that they truly cultivate good quality of people like thinking others kind while those in China like the Jia family described in famous novel Hongloumeng are actually very indecent/stupid in spirit except richness. And the noble in English is small-family(similar to modern family) style while that in China is big-family style(many generation people live together). Also people in English is less constrained than ancient China, like Mr and Mrs is pretty equal in family affairs while one man has several wives and the wife are severely constrained by Confucianism in ancient China.   

Compare Elizabeth and Jane to the girls in Hongloumeng(HLM) in nearly the same era is also very interesting. First, HLM girls are not allowed to go outdoos and meet other single man except their brother Jiabaoyu. The life they live is the same everyday, wherea English girls surely not so(they could travel and appear in public). Second, the most important thing for both of them is the marriage. English has balls for the young ladies and men meet each other (at least free to choose among many young men) while  HLM know nothing about men but their father, could only be arranged for marriage. And HLM girls are married very young about 15 years old while 20+ years old in English. Xuebaochai and Lindaiyu in HLM are as smart as Elizabeth, in judging others' character, in literature, in analyzing the affairs. But their environment is much severer than Lizze's that they almost never correctly rebel against the fate arranged (if the death of Lindaiyu could be seen as a negative rebellion). Everybody is saying good to maintain a superficial peace in family especially towards the grandmother. 

In summary, this is a good book, in terms of its content, well describing how a young couple learned to know each other which they valued most for their marriage and how the character of a person could be changed gradually by their reflection, their own free judgement, even in a not good family environment(her mother). And the mental activity of people is detailed and vivid. The writing style is active and easy to read, although I don't like the complex sentence structure which is pretty difficult for a non-native English learner. I want to read another book with broader view dealing with the inferior class like the maid, housekeeper.  
## Worldviews
### Richard Dewitt
I feel fear in pure darkness, especially when I am right now in a remote village which even has no street lamps at night. I don't know how this fear comes, possibly rooting from our ancestor's unsafe living experience at night under a risk of attack from other animal, etc.. In my worldviews, my fear is mainly represented by a fear of being attacked from something I cannot see, naturally according to what I was taught when I was a young child, it's ghost (That means my cognition on this point hasn't change so many years.). My fear is like this, when I'm walking in my yard, I may be attacked abruptly by something behind me, although I cannot clearly say what the attack will look like. 
I think worldview is such a thing, how you interpret things around you. It's not only about our idea about the universe like the book is mainly about, but also many details like how we intuitively interpret the reaction/behavior of others, how we face difficulties (if you take unfortune/difficulty as something which should not strike you, it may indicate how you think about the world). Therefore, in my opinion, worldviews is very comprehensive, much beyond our cognition about the physics of the universe. 
人死后会变成鬼（因此拥有对人类世界的知识），鬼是飘忽不定的，鬼可以对任何人在晚上实施打击，其长相往往是悲惨的，这是我全部关于鬼的知识，还有人比我前进一步，发明了阴曹地府、阎王等一套与鬼相关的社会生活规范。可是具体地，如何证明其真实存在性呢？应该是大家都能观察得到，如果存在这样一群”生物“，一定会有很多人，而且是国家支持着研究它们，因为既然它能对人类世界具有如此大的破坏力，我们人类就不能坐以待毙，而且毫无保密的必要，因为这是人类普遍认可的存在于社会生活中的现象。但是并没有，事实是全部我能获得的相关信息来自农村生活中女人们的口头聊天，这就像魔幻、武侠、童话（海绵宝宝）、或者任何虚拟的世界，人们可以凭借想象力把它构建得很丰富，但是怎么证明海绵宝宝真的存在或不存在呢？答案是显然的，如果我们都承认我们生活在现实世界。
回到本书，鬼就是一种本书所述的哲学性/概念性事实，而且它构成了我之前的核心观点，核心观点的意思是说它是整个对世界的观点体系中的核心部分，拿掉了它我就得重新去解释我所听到的相关事实，比如从大脑幻听幻视（神经系统本身的不稳定性），以及放弃由此推演出的外围观点体系如叫魂/出殃。以上就是本书对我的最主要的现实启发，并不涉及全书主要的牛顿世界观、相对论、量子理论、演化论，但是它确实启发我从新的视角看待自己的观点体系，以及其中有多少是显而易见的有问题的，除了打破，接下来的问题是：我要用什么新的观点体系来代替旧有的以鬼的存在为核心的观点体系，以更好地解释相关事实（在我看来，唯一的事实来源于大家在脑中的畅想，那么如何从脑科学的角度来更好地解释她们口中所谓的”听到死去的老伴在房间里翻箱倒柜“），而不像原来的以鬼为核心的观点体系所面临的”过于空泛，容易过度解释“的问题。
大脑如何认识世界的，从别人认为的事实中听信别人的似是而非的判断，成为自己的核心观点体系，再从这个核心观点出发来推理自己生活中遇到的问题。这里面存在很多逻辑漏洞：如对普通的毫无研究能力的人的轻信。
我发现如果你perceive世界as unsafe，你会把世界上任何发生的你不知道的事翻译成恐惧和是对你的打击。然后强大的基底核会干扰皮层的判断，甚至让你产生幻听幻视，这往往是在人过分敏感的时候。
