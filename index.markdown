# Bio
During my Master study, I focus on the neural mechanism of sensorimotor function and its applications to brain machine interface. To continue this passion, I'm currently applying for a PhD position in US to start a career in this field. I obtained my Master degree in Mechanical Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, in 2019. I visited Caltech at Richard Andersen's lab from Nov., 2018 to May, 2019. I accomplished my undergraduate study at Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2016 with honor. 

I love outdoor activities like hiking, biking, etc. I love reading books covering many topics.
